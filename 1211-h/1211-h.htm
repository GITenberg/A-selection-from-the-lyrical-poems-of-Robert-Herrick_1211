      ROBERT HERRICK - Born 1591 : Died 1674
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who most admire the Poet from whose many pieces a selection only is
      here offered, will, it is probable, feel most strongly (with the Editor)
      that excuse is needed for an attempt of an obviously presumptuous nature.
      The choice made by any selector invites challenge: the admission, perhaps,
      of some poems, the absence of more, will be censured:&mdash;Whilst others
      may wholly condemn the process, in virtue of an argument not unfrequently
      advanced of late, that a writer's judgment on his own work is to be
      considered final. And his book to be taken as he left it, or left
      altogether; a literal reproduction of the original text being occasionally
      included in this requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If poetry were composed solely for her faithful band of true lovers and
      true students, such a facsimile as that last indicated would have claims
      irresistible; but if the first and last object of this, as of the other
      Fine Arts, may be defined in language borrowed from a different range of
      thought, as 'the greatest pleasure of the greatest number,' it is certain
      that less stringent forms of reproduction are required and justified. The
      great majority of readers cannot bring either leisure or taste, or
      information sufficient to take them through a large mass (at any rate) of
      ancient verse, not even if it be Spenser's or Milton's. Manners and modes
      of speech, again, have changed; and much that was admissible centuries
      since, or at least sought admission, has now, by a law against which
      protest is idle, lapsed into the indecorous. Even unaccustomed forms of
      spelling are an effort to the eye;&mdash;a kind of friction, which
      diminishes the ease and enjoyment of the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      These hindrances and clogs, of very diverse nature, cannot be disregarded
      by Poetry. In common with everything which aims at human benefit, she must
      work not only for the 'faithful': she has also the duty of 'conversion.'
      Like a messenger from heaven, it is hers to inspire, to console, to
      elevate: to convert the world, in a word, to herself. Every rough place
      that slackens her footsteps must be made smooth; nor, in this Art, need
      there be fear that the way will ever be vulgarized by too much ease, nor
      that she will be loved less by the elect, for being loved more widely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing from these general considerations, it is true that a selection
      framed in conformity with them, especially if one of our older poets be
      concerned, parts with a certain portion of the pleasure which poetry may
      confer. A writer is most thoroughly to be judged by the whole of what he
      printed. A selector inevitably holds too despotic a position over his
      author. The frankness of speech which we have abandoned is an interesting
      evidence how the tone of manners changes. The poet's own spelling and
      punctuation bear, or may bear, a gleam of his personality. But such last
      drops of pleasure are the reward of fully-formed taste; and fully-formed
      taste cannot be reached without full knowledge. This, we have noticed,
      most readers cannot bring. Hence, despite all drawbacks, an anthology may
      have its place. A book which tempts many to read a little, will guide some
      to that more profound and loving study of which the result is, the full
      accomplishment of the poet's mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have, probably, no poet to whom the reasons here advanced to justify
      the invidious task of selection apply more fully and forcibly than to
      Herrick. Highly as he is to be rated among our lyrists, no one who reads
      through his fourteen hundred pieces can reasonably doubt that whatever may
      have been the influences,&mdash;wholly unknown to us,&mdash;which
      determined the contents of his volume, severe taste was not one of them.
      PECAT FORTITER:&mdash;his exquisite directness and simplicity of speech
      repeatedly take such form that the book cannot be offered to a very large
      number of those readers who would most enjoy it. The spelling is at once
      arbitrary and obsolete. Lastly, the complete reproduction of the original
      text, with explanatory notes, edited by Mr Grosart, supplies materials
      equally full and interesting for those who may, haply, be allured by this
      little book to master one of our most attractive poets in his integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Herrick's single own edition of HESPERIDES and NOBLE NUMBERS, but
      little arrangement is traceable: nor have we more than a few internal
      signs of date in composition. It would hence be unwise to attempt grouping
      the poems on a strict plan: and the divisions under which they are here
      ranged must be regarded rather as progressive aspects of a landscape than
      as territorial demarcations. Pieces bearing on the poet as such are placed
      first; then, those vaguely definable as of idyllic character, 'his girls,'
      epigrams, poems on natural objects, on character and life; lastly, a few
      in his religious vein. For the text, although reference has been made to
      the original of 1647-8, Mr Grosart's excellent reprint has been mainly
      followed. And to that edition this book is indebted for many valuable
      exegetical notes, kindly placed at the Editor's disposal. But for much
      fuller elucidation both of words and allusions, and of the persons
      mentioned, readers are referred to Mr Grosart's volumes, which (like the
      same scholar's 'Sidney' and 'Donne'), for the first time give Herrick a
      place among books not printed only, but edited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Herrick's personal fate is in one point like Shakespeare's. We know
      or seem to know them both, through their works, with singular intimacy.
      But with this our knowledge substantially ends. No private letter of
      Shakespeare, no record of his conversation, no account of the
      circumstances in which his writings were published, remains: hardly any
      statement how his greatest contemporaries ranked him. A group of Herrick's
      youthful letters on business has, indeed, been preserved; of his life and
      studies, of his reputation during his own time, almost nothing. For
      whatever facts affectionate diligence could now gather. Readers are
      referred to Mr Grosart's 'Introduction.' But if, to supplement the
      picture, inevitably imperfect, which this gives, we turn to Herrick's own
      book, we learn little, biographically, except the names of a few friends,&mdash;that
      his general sympathies were with the Royal cause,&mdash;and that he
      wearied in Devonshire for London. So far as is known, he published but
      this one volume, and that, when not far from his sixtieth year. Some
      pieces may be traced in earlier collections; some few carry ascertainable
      dates; the rest lie over a period of near forty years, during a great
      portion of which we have no distinct account where Herrick lived, or what
      were his employments. We know that he shone with Ben Jonson and the wits
      at the nights and suppers of those gods of our glorious early literature:
      we may fancy him at Beaumanor, or Houghton, with his uncle and cousins,
      keeping a Leicestershire Christmas in the Manor-house: or, again, in some
      sweet southern county with Julia and Anthea, Corinna and Dianeme by his
      side (familiar then by other names now never to be remembered), sitting
      merry, but with just the sadness of one who hears sweet music, in some
      meadow among his favourite flowers of spring-time;&mdash;there, or 'where
      the rose lingers latest.' .... But 'the dream, the fancy,' is all that
      Time has spared us. And if it be curious that his contemporaries should
      have left so little record of this delightful poet and (as we should infer
      from the book) genial-hearted man, it is not less so that the single first
      edition should have satisfied the seventeenth century, and that, before
      the present, notices of Herrick should be of the rarest occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist's 'claim to exist' is, however, always far less to be looked
      for in his life, than in his art, upon the secret of which the fullest
      biography can tell us little&mdash;as little, perhaps, as criticism can
      analyse its charm. But there are few of our poets who stand less in need
      than Herrick of commentaries of this description,&mdash;in which too often
      we find little more than a dull or florid prose version of what the author
      has given us admirably in verse. Apart from obsolete words or allusions,
      Herrick is the best commentator upon Herrick. A few lines only need
      therefore here be added, aiming rather to set forth his place in the
      sequence of English poets, and especially in regard to those near his own
      time, than to point out in detail beauties which he unveils in his own
      way, and so most durably and delightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our Muses, silent or sick for a century and more after Chaucer's
      death, during the years of war and revolution, reappeared, they brought
      with them foreign modes of art, ancient and contemporary, in the forms of
      which they began to set to music the new material which the age supplied.
      At the very outset, indeed, the moralizing philosophy which has
      characterized the English from the beginning of our national history,
      appears in the writers of the troubled times lying between the last regnal
      years of Henry VIII and the first of his great daughter. But with the
      happier hopes of Elizabeth's accession, poetry was once more distinctly
      followed, not only as a means of conveying thought, but as a Fine Art. And
      hence something constrained and artificial blends with the freshness of
      the Elizabethan literature. For its great underlying elements it
      necessarily reverts to those embodied in our own earlier poets, Chaucer
      above all, to whom, after barely one hundred and fifty years, men looked
      up as a father of song: but in points of style and treatment, the poets of
      the sixteenth century lie under a double external influence&mdash;that of
      the poets of Greece and Rome (known either in their own tongues or by
      translation), and that of the modern literatures which had themselves
      undergone the same classical impulse. Italy was the source most regarded
      during the more strictly Elizabethan period; whence its lyrical poetry and
      the dramatic in a less degree, are coloured much less by pure and severe
      classicalism with its closeness to reality, than by the allegorical and
      elaborate style, fancy and fact curiously blended, which had been
      generated in Italy under the peculiar and local circumstances of her
      pilgrimage in literature and art from the age of Dante onwards. Whilst
      that influence lasted, such brilliant pictures of actual life, such
      directness, movement, and simplicity in style, as Chaucer often shows,
      were not yet again attainable: and although satire, narrative, the poetry
      of reflection, were meanwhile not wholly unknown, yet they only appear in
      force at the close of this period. And then also the pressure of political
      and religious strife, veiled in poetry during the greater part of
      Elizabeth's actual reign under the forms of pastoral and allegory, again
      imperiously breaks in upon the gracious but somewhat slender and
      artificial fashions of England's Helicon: the DIVOM NUMEN, SEDESQUE
      QUIETAE which, in some degree the Elizabethan poets offer, disappear;
      until filling the central years of the seventeenth century we reach an age
      as barren for inspiration of new song as the Wars of the Roses; although
      the great survivors from earlier years mask this sterility;&mdash;masking
      also the revolution in poetical manner and matter which we can see
      secretly preparing in the later 'Cavalier' poets, but which was not
      clearly recognised before the time of Dryden's culmination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the period here briefly sketched, what is Herrick's portion? His verse
      is eminent for sweet and gracious fluency; this is a real note of the
      'Elizabethan' poets. His subjects are frequently pastoral, with a
      classical tinge, more or less slight, infused; his language, though not
      free from exaggeration, is generally free from intellectual conceits and
      distortion, and is eminent throughout for a youthful NAIVETE. Such, also,
      are qualities of the latter sixteenth century literature. But if these
      characteristics might lead us to call Herrick 'the last of the
      Elizabethans,' born out of due time, the differences between him and them
      are not less marked. Herrick's directness of speech is accompanied by an
      equally clear and simple presentment of his thought; we have, perhaps, no
      poet who writes more consistently and earnestly with his eye upon his
      subject. An allegorical or mystical treatment is alien from him: he
      handles awkwardly the few traditional fables which he introduces. He is
      also wholly free from Italianizing tendencies: his classicalism even is
      that of an English student,&mdash;of a schoolboy, indeed, if he be
      compared with a Jonson or a Milton. Herrick's personal eulogies on his
      friends and others, further, witness to the extension of the field of
      poetry after Elizabeth's age;&mdash;in which his enthusiastic geniality,
      his quick and easy transitions of subject, have also little precedent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, again, we compare Herrick's book with those of his fellow-poets for a
      hundred years before, very few are the traces which he gives of imitation,
      or even of study. During the long interval between Herrick's entrance on
      his Cambridge and his clerical careers (an interval all but wholly obscure
      to us), it is natural to suppose that he read, at any rate, his
      Elizabethan predecessors: yet (beyond those general similarities already
      noticed) the Editor can find no positive proof of familiarity. Compare
      Herrick with Marlowe, Greene, Breton, Drayton, or other pretty
      pastoralists of the HELICON&mdash;his general and radical unlikeness is
      what strikes us; whilst he is even more remote from the passionate
      intensity of Sidney and Shakespeare, the Italian graces of Spenser, the
      pensive beauty of PARTHENOPHIL, of DIELLA, of FIDESSA, of the
      HECATOMPATHIA and the TEARS OF FANCY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor is Herrick's resemblance nearer to many of the contemporaries who have
      been often grouped with him. He has little in common with the courtly
      elegance, the learned polish, which too rarely redeem commonplace and
      conceits in Carew, Habington, Lovelace, Cowley, or Waller. Herrick has his
      CONCETTI also: but they are in him generally true plays of fancy; he
      writes throughout far more naturally than these lyrists, who, on the other
      hand, in their unfrequent successes reach a more complete and classical
      form of expression. Thus, when Carew speaks of an aged fair one
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   When beauty, youth, and all sweets leave her,
   Love may return, but lovers never!
</pre>
    <p>
      Cowley, of his mistress&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Love in her sunny eyes does basking play,
   Love walks the pleasant mazes of her hair:
</pre>
    <p>
      or take Lovelace, 'To Lucasta,' Waller, in his 'Go, lovely rose,'&mdash;we
      have a finish and condensation which Herrick hardly attains; a literary
      quality alien from his 'woodnotes wild,' which may help us to understand
      the very small appreciation he met from his age. He had 'a pretty pastoral
      gale of fancy,' said Phillips, cursorily dismissing Herrick in his
      THEATRUM: not suspecting how inevitably artifice and mannerism, if
      fashionable for awhile, pass into forgetfulness, whilst the simple cry of
      Nature partake in her permanence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donne and Marvell, stronger men, leave also no mark on our poet. The
      elaborate thought, the metrical harshness of the first, could find no
      counterpart in Herrick; whilst Marvell, beyond him in imaginative power,
      though twisting it too often into contortion and excess, appears to have
      been little known as a lyrist then:&mdash;as, indeed, his great merits
      have never reached anything like due popular recognition. Yet Marvell's
      natural description is nearer Herrick's in felicity and insight than any
      of the poets named above. Nor, again, do we trace anything of Herbert or
      Vaughan in Herrick's NOBLE NUMBERS, which, though unfairly judged if held
      insincere, are obviously far distant from the intense conviction, the
      depth and inner fervour of his high-toned contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is among the great dramatists of this age that we find the only English
      influences palpably operative on this singularly original writer. The
      greatest, in truth, is wholly absent: and it is remarkable that although
      Herrick may have joined in the wit-contests and genialities of the
      literary clubs in London soon after Shakespeare's death, and certainly
      lived in friendship with some who had known him, yet his name is never
      mentioned in the poetical commemorations of the HESPERIDES. In Herrick,
      echoes from Fletcher's idyllic pieces in the FAITHFUL SHEPHERDESS are
      faintly traceable; from his songs, 'Hear what Love can do,' and 'The lusty
      Spring,' more distinctly. But to Ben Jonson, whom Herrick addresses as his
      patron saint in song, and ranks on the highest list of his friends, his
      obligations are much more perceptible. In fact, Jonson's non-dramatic
      poetry,&mdash;the EPIGRAMS and FOREST of 1616, the UNDERWOODS of 1641, (he
      died in 1637),&mdash;supply models, generally admirable in point of art,
      though of very unequal merit in their execution and contents, of the
      principal forms under which we may range Herrick's HESPERIDES. The
      graceful love-song, the celebration of feasts and wit, the encomia of
      friends, the epigram as then understood, are all here represented: even
      Herrick's vein in natural description is prefigured in the odes to
      Penshurst and Sir Robert Wroth, of 1616. And it is in the religious pieces
      of the NOBLE NUMBERS, for which Jonson afforded the least copious
      precedents, that, as a rule, Herrick is least successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if we had not the verses on his own book, (the most noteworthy of
      which are here printed as PREFATORY,) in proof that Herrick was no
      careless singer, but a true artist, working with conscious knowledge of
      his art, we might have inferred the fact from the choice of Jonson as his
      model. That great poet, as Clarendon justly remarked, had 'judgment to
      order and govern fancy, rather than excess of fancy: his productions being
      slow and upon deliberation.' No writer could be better fitted for the
      guidance of one so fancy-free as Herrick; to whom the curb, in the old
      phrase, was more needful than the spur, and whose invention, more fertile
      and varied than Jonson's, was ready at once to fill up the moulds of form
      provided. He does this with a lively facility, contrasting much with the
      evidence of labour in his master's work. Slowness and deliberation are the
      last qualities suggested by Herrick. Yet it may be doubted whether the
      volatile ease, the effortless grace, the wild bird-like fluency with which
      he
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Scatters his loose notes in the waste of air
</pre>
    <p>
      are not, in truth, the results of exquisite art working in cooperation
      with the gifts of nature. The various readings which our few remaining
      manuscripts or printed versions have supplied to Mr Grosart's
      'Introduction,' attest the minute and curious care with which Herrick
      polished and strengthened his own work: his airy facility, his seemingly
      spontaneous melodies, as with Shelley&mdash;his counterpart in pure
      lyrical art within this century&mdash;were earned by conscious labour;
      perfect freedom was begotten of perfect art;&mdash;nor, indeed, have
      excellence and permanence any other parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the error that regards Herrick as a careless singer is closely twined
      that which ranks him in the school of that master of elegant pettiness who
      has usurped and abused the name Anacreon; as a mere light-hearted writer
      of pastorals, a gay and frivolous Renaissance amourist. He has indeed
      those elements: but with them is joined the seriousness of an age which
      knew that the light mask of classicalism and bucolic allegory could be
      worn only as an ornament, and that life held much deeper and
      further-reaching issues than were visible to the narrow horizons within
      which Horace or Martial circumscribed the range of their art. Between the
      most intensely poetical, and so, greatest, among the French poets of this
      century, and Herrick, are many points of likeness. He too, with Alfred de
      Musset, might have said
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Quoi que nous puissions faire,
  Je souffre; il est trop tard; le monde s'est fait vieux.
  Une immense esperance a traverse la terre;
  Malgre nous vers le ciel il faut lever les yeux.
</pre>
    <p>
      Indeed, Herrick's deepest debt to ancient literature lies not in the
      models which he directly imitated, nor in the Anacreontic tone which with
      singular felicity he has often taken. These are common to many writers
      with him:&mdash;nor will he who cannot learn more from the great ancient
      world ever rank among poets of high order, or enter the innermost
      sanctuary of art. But, the power to describe men and things as the poet
      sees them with simple sincerity, insight, and grace: to paint scenes and
      imaginations as perfect organic wholes;&mdash;carrying with it the gift to
      clothe each picture, as if by unerring instinct, in fit metrical form,
      giving to each its own music; beginning without affectation, and rounding
      off without effort;&mdash;the power, in a word, to leave simplicity,
      sanity, and beauty as the last impressions lingering on our minds, these
      gifts are at once the true bequest of classicalism, and the reason why
      (until modern effort equals them) the study of that Hellenic and Latin
      poetry in which these gifts are eminent above all other literatures yet
      created, must be essential. And it is success in precisely these
      excellences which is here claimed for Herrick. He is classical in the
      great and eternal sense of the phrase: and much more so, probably, than he
      was himself aware of. No poet in fact is so far from dwelling in a past or
      foreign world: it is the England, if not of 1648, at least of his youth,
      in which he lives and moves and loves: his Bucolics show no trace of
      Sicily: his Anthea and Julia wear no 'buckles of the purest gold,' nor
      have anything about them foreign to Middlesex or Devon. Herrick's
      imagination has no far horizons: like Burns and Crabbe fifty years since,
      or Barnes (that exquisite and neglected pastoralist of fair Dorset,
      perfect within his narrower range as Herrick) to-day, it is his own native
      land only which he sees and paints: even the fairy world in which, at
      whatever inevitable interval, he is second to Shakespeare, is pure
      English; or rather, his elves live in an elfin county of their own, and
      are all but severed from humanity. Within that greater circle of
      Shakespeare, where Oberon and Ariel and their fellows move, aiding or
      injuring mankind, and reflecting human life in a kind of unconscious
      parody, Herrick cannot walk: and it may have been due to his good sense
      and true feeling for art, that here, where resemblance might have seemed
      probable, he borrows nothing from MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM or TEMPEST. if
      we are moved by the wider range of Byron's or Shelley's sympathies, there
      is a charm, also, in this sweet insularity of Herrick; a narrowness
      perhaps, yet carrying with it a healthful reality absent from the vapid
      and artificial 'cosmopolitanism' that did such wrong on Goethe's genius.
      If he has not the exotic blooms and strange odours which poets who derive
      from literature show in their conservatories, Herrick has the fresh breeze
      and thyme-bed fragrance of open moorland, the grace and greenery of
      English meadows: with Homer and Dante, he too shares the strength and
      inspiration which come from touch of a man's native soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has been here sketched is not planned so much as a criticism in form
      on Herrick's poetry as an attempt to seize his relations to his
      predecessors and contemporaries. If we now tentatively inquire what place
      may be assigned to him in our literature at large, Herrick has no single
      lyric to show equal, in pomp of music, brilliancy of diction, or elevation
      of sentiment to some which Spenser before, Milton in his own time, Dryden
      and Gray, Wordsworth and Shelley, since have given us. Nor has he, as
      already noticed, the peculiar finish and reserve (if the phrase may be
      allowed) traceable, though rarely, in Ben Jonson and others of the
      seventeenth century. He does not want passion; yet his passion wants
      concentration: it is too ready, also, to dwell on externals: imagination
      with him generally appears clothed in forms of fancy. Among his
      contemporaries, take Crashaw's 'Wishes': Sir J. Beaumont's elegy on his
      child Gervase: take Bishop King's 'Surrender':
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My once-dear Love!&mdash;hapless, that I no more
  Must call thee so. . . . The rich affection's store
  That fed our hopes, lies now exhaust and spent,
  Like sums of treasure unto bankrupts lent:&mdash;
  We that did nothing study but the way
  To love each other, with which thoughts the day
  Rose with delight to us, and with them set,
  Must learn the hateful art, how to forget!
  &mdash;Fold back our arms, take home our fruitless loves,
  That must new fortunes try, like turtle doves
  Dislodged from their haunts. We must in tears
  Unwind a love knit up in many years.
  In this one kiss I here surrender thee
  Back to thyself:  so thou again art free:&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      take eight lines by some old unknown Northern singer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  When I think on the happy days
  I spent wi' you, my dearie,
  And now what lands between us lie,
  How can I be but eerie!

  How slow ye move, ye heavy hours,
  As ye were wae and weary!
  It was na sae ye glinted by
  When I was wi' my dearie:&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      &mdash;O! there is an intensity here, a note of passion beyond the deepest
      of Herrick's. This tone (whether from temperament or circumstance or
      scheme of art), is wanting to the HESPERIDES and NOBLE NUMBERS: nor does
      Herrick's lyre, sweet and varied as it is, own that purple chord, that
      more inwoven harmony, possessed by poets of greater depth and splendour,&mdash;by
      Shakespeare and Milton often, by Spenser more rarely. But if we put aside
      these 'greater gods' of song, with Sidney,&mdash;in the Editor's judgment
      Herrick's mastery (to use a brief expression), both over Nature and over
      Art, clearly assigns to him the first place as lyrical poet, in the strict
      and pure sense of the phrase, among all who flourished during the interval
      between Henry V and a hundred years since. Single pieces of equal, a few
      of higher, quality, we have, indeed, meanwhile received, not only from the
      master-singers who did not confine themselves to the Lyric, but from many
      poets&mdash;some the unknown contributors to our early anthologies, then
      Jonson, Marvell, Waller, Collins, and others, with whom we reach the
      beginning of the wider sweep which lyrical poetry has since taken. Yet,
      looking at the whole work, not at the selected jewels, of this great and
      noble multitude, Herrick, as lyrical poet strictly, offers us by far the
      most homogeneous, attractive, and varied treasury. No one else among
      lyrists within the period defined, has such unfailing freshness: so much
      variety within the sphere prescribed to himself: such closeness to nature,
      whether in description or in feeling: such easy fitness in language:
      melody so unforced and delightful. His dull pages are much less frequent:
      he has more lines, in his own phrase, 'born of the royal blood': the
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Inflata rore non Achaico verba
</pre>
    <p>
      are rarer with him: although superficially mannered, nature is so much
      nearer to him, that far fewer of his pieces have lost vitality and
      interest through adherence to forms of feeling or fashions of thought now
      obsolete. A Roman contemporary is described by the younger Pliny in words
      very appropriate to Herrick: who, in fact, if Greek in respect of his
      method and style, in the contents of his poetry displays the 'frankness of
      nature and vivid sense of life' which criticism assigns as marks of the
      great Roman poets. FACIT VERSUS, QUALES CATULLUS AUT CALVUS. QUANTUM ILLIS
      LEPORIS, DULCEDINIS, AMARITUDINIS AMORIS! INSERIT SANE, SED DATA OPERA,
      MOLLIBUS LENIBUSQUE DURIUSCULOS QUOSDAM; ET HOC, QUASI CATULLUS AUT
      CALVUS. Many pieces have been, here refused admittance, whether from
      coarseness of phrase or inferior value: yet these are rarely defective in
      the lyrical art, which, throughout the writer's work, is so simple and
      easy as almost to escape notice through its very excellence. In one word,
      Herrick, in a rare and special sense, is unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these qualities we may, perhaps, ascribe the singular neglect which, so
      far as we may infer, he met with in his own age, and certainly in the
      century following. For the men of the Restoration period he was too
      natural, too purely poetical: he had not the learned polish, the political
      allusion, the tone of the city, the didactic turn, which were then and
      onwards demanded from poetry. In the next age, no tradition consecrated
      his name; whilst writers of a hundred years before were then too remote
      for familiarity, and not remote enough for reverence. Moving on to our own
      time, when some justice has at length been conceded to him, Herrick has to
      meet the great rivalry of the poets who, from Burns and Cowper to
      Tennyson, have widened and deepened the lyrical sphere, making it at once
      on the one hand more intensely personal, on the other, more free and
      picturesque in the range of problems dealt with: whilst at the same time
      new and richer lyrical forms, harmonies more intricate and seven-fold,
      have been created by them, as in Hellas during her golden age of song, to
      embody ideas and emotions unknown or unexpressed under Tudors and Stuarts.
      To this latter superiority Herrick would, doubtless, have bowed, as he
      bowed before Ben Jonson's genius. 'Rural ditties,' and 'oaten flute'
      cannot bear the competition of the full modern orchestra. Yet this author
      need not fear! That exquisite: and lofty pleasure which it is the first
      and the last aim of all true art to give, must, by its own nature, be
      lasting also. As the eyesight fluctuates, and gives the advantage to
      different colours in turn, so to the varying moods of the mind the same
      beauty does not always seem equally beautiful. Thus from the 'purple
      light' of our later poetry there are hours in which we may look to the
      daffodil and rose-tints of Herrick's old Arcadia, for refreshment and
      delight. And the pleasure which he gives is as eminently wholesome as
      pleasurable. Like the holy river of Virgil, to the souls who drink of him,
      Herrick offers 'securos latices.' He is conspicuously free from many of
      the maladies incident to his art. Here is no overstrain, no spasmodic cry,
      so wire-drawn analysis or sensational rhetoric, no music without sense, no
      mere second-hand literary inspiration, no mannered archaism:&mdash;above
      all, no sickly sweetness, no subtle, unhealthy affectation. Throughout his
      work, whether when it is strong, or in the less worthy portions, sanity,
      sincerity, simplicity, lucidity, are everywhere the characteristics of
      Herrick: in these, not in his pretty Pagan masquerade, he shows the note,&mdash;the
      only genuine note,&mdash;of Hellenic descent. Hence, through whatever
      changes and fashions poetry may pass, her true lovers he is likely to
      'please now, and please for long.' His verse, in the words of a poet
      greater than himself, is of that quality which 'adds sunlight to
      daylight'; which is able to 'make the happy happier.' He will, it may be
      hoped, carry to the many Englands across the seas, east and west, pictures
      of English life exquisite in truth and grace:&mdash;to the more fortunate
      inhabitants (as they must perforce hold themselves!) of the old country,
      her image, as she was two centuries since, will live in the 'golden
      apples' of the West, offered to us by this sweet singer of Devonshire. We
      have greater poets, not a few; none more faithful to nature as he saw her,
      none more perfect in his art;&mdash;none, more companionable:&mdash;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Whither, mad maiden, wilt thou roam?
     Far safer 'twere to stay at home;

     The poor and private cottages.
     Since cotes and hamlets best agree
     With this thy meaner minstrelsy.
     There with the reed thou mayst express
     The shepherd's fleecy happiness;
     And with thy Eclogues intermix:
     Some smooth and harmless Bucolics.
     There, on a hillock, thou mayst sing
     Unto a handsome shepherdling;
     Or to a girl, that keeps the neat,
     With breath more sweet than violet.
     There, there, perhaps such lines as these
     May take the simple villages;
     But for the court, the country wit
     Is despicable unto it.
     Stay then at home, and do not go
     Or fly abroad to seek for woe;
     Contempts in courts and cities dwell
     No critic haunts the poor man's cell,
     Where thou mayst hear thine own lines read
     By no one tongue there censured.
     That man's unwise will search for ill,
     And may prevent it, sitting still.

     Only a little more
     I have to write:
     Then I'll give o'er,
     And bid the world good-night.

     'Tis but a flying minute,
     That I must stay,
     Or linger in it:
     And then I must away.

     O Time, that cut'st down all,
     And scarce leav'st here
     Memorial
     Of any men that were;

     &mdash;How many lie forgot
     In vaults beneath,

      16. THE COUNTRY LIFE:
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     TO THE HONOURED MR ENDYMION PORTER,
     GROOM OF THE BED-CHAMBER TO HIS MAJESTY

     Sweet country life, to such unknown,
     Whose lives are others', not their own!
     But serving courts and cities, be
     Less happy, less enjoying thee.
     Thou never plough'st the ocean's foam
     To seek and bring rough pepper home:
     Nor to the Eastern Ind dost rove
     To bring from thence the scorched clove:
     Nor, with the loss of thy loved rest,
     Bring'st home the ingot from the West.
     No, thy ambition's master-piece
     Flies no thought higher than a fleece:
     Or how to pay thy hinds, and clear
     All scores: and so to end the year:
     But walk'st about thine own dear bounds,
     Not envying others' larger grounds:
     For well thou know'st, 'tis not th' extent
     Of land makes life, but sweet content.
     When now the cock (the ploughman's horn)
     Calls forth the lily-wristed morn;
     Then to thy corn-fields thou dost go,
     Which though well soil'd, yet thou dost know
     That the best compost for the lands
     Is the wise master's feet, and hands.
     There at the plough thou find'st thy team,
     With a hind whistling there to them:
     And cheer'st them up, by singing how
     The kingdom's portion is the plough.
     This done, then to th' enamell'd meads
     Thou go'st; and as thy foot there treads,
     Thou seest a present God-like power
     Imprinted in each herb and flower:
     And smell'st the breath of great-eyed kine,
     Sweet as the blossoms of the vine.
     Here thou behold'st thy large sleek neat
     Unto the dew-laps up in meat:
     And, as thou look'st, the wanton steer,
     The heifer, cow, and ox draw near,
     To make a pleasing pastime there.
     These seen, thou go'st to view thy flocks
     Of sheep, safe from the wolf and fox,
     And find'st their bellies there as full
     Of short sweet grass, as backs with wool:
     And leav'st them, as they feed and fill,
     A shepherd piping on a hill.

     For sports, for pageantry, and plays,
     Thou hast thy eves, and holydays:
     On which the young men and maids meet,
     To exercise their dancing feet:
     Tripping the comely country Round,
     With daffadils and daisies crown'd.
     Thy wakes, thy quintels, here thou hast,
     Thy May-poles too with garlands graced;
     Thy Morris-dance; thy Whitsun-ale;
     Thy shearing-feast, which never fail.
     Thy harvest home; thy wassail bowl,
     That's toss'd up after Fox i' th' hole:
     Thy mummeries; thy Twelve-tide kings
     And queens; thy Christmas revellings:
     Thy nut-brown mirth, thy russet wit,
     And no man pays too dear for it.&mdash;
     To these, thou hast thy times to go
     And trace the hare i' th' treacherous snow:
     Thy witty wiles to draw, and get
     The lark into the trammel net:
     Thou hast thy cockrood, and thy glade
     To take the precious pheasant made:
     Thy lime-twigs, snares, and pit-falls then
     To catch the pilfering birds, not men.

     &mdash;O happy life!  if that their good
     The husbandmen but understood!
     Who all the day themselves do please,
     And younglings, with such sports as these:
     And lying down, have nought t' affright
     Sweet Sleep, that makes more short the night.
     CAETERA DESUNT&mdash;

      17. TO PHILLIS, TO LOVE AND LIVE WITH HIM
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Live, live with me, and thou shalt see
     The pleasures I'll prepare for thee:
     What sweets the country can afford
     Shall bless thy bed, and bless thy board.
     The soft sweet moss shall be thy bed,
     With crawling woodbine over-spread:
     By which the silver-shedding streams
     Shall gently melt thee into dreams.
     Thy clothing next, shall be a gown
     Made of the fleeces' purest down.
     The tongues of kids shall be thy meat;
     Their milk thy drink; and thou shalt eat
     The paste of filberts for thy bread
     With cream of cowslips buttered:
     Thy feasting-table shall be hills
     With daisies spread, and daffadils;
     Where thou shalt sit, and Red-breast by,
     For meat, shall give thee melody.
     I'll give thee chains and carcanets
     Of primroses and violets.
     A bag and bottle thou shalt have,
     That richly wrought, and this as brave;
     So that as either shall express
     The wearer's no mean shepherdess.
     At shearing-times, and yearly wakes,
     When Themilis his pastime makes,
     There thou shalt be; and be the wit,
     Nay more, the feast, and grace of it.
     On holydays, when virgins meet
     To dance the heys with nimble feet,
     Thou shalt come forth, and then appear
     The Queen of Roses for that year.
     And having danced ('bove all the best)
     Carry the garland from the rest,
     In wicker-baskets maids shall bring
     To thee, my dearest shepherdling,
     The blushing apple, bashful pear,
     And shame-faced plum, all simp'ring there.
     Walk in the groves, and thou shalt find
     The name of Phillis in the rind
     Of every straight and smooth-skin tree;
     Where kissing that, I'll twice kiss thee.
     To thee a sheep-hook I will send,
     Be-prank'd with ribbands, to this end,
     This, this alluring hook might be
     Less for to catch a sheep, than me.
     Thou shalt have possets, wassails fine,
     Not made of ale, but spiced wine;
     To make thy maids and self free mirth,
     All sitting near the glitt'ring hearth.
     Thou shalt have ribbands, roses, rings,
     Gloves, garters, stockings, shoes, and strings
     Of winning colours, that shall move
     Others to lust, but me to love.
     &mdash;These, nay, and more, thine own shall be,
     If thou wilt love, and live with me.

      18. THE WASSAIL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Give way, give way, ye gates, and win
     An easy blessing to your bin
     And basket, by our entering in.

     May both with manchet stand replete;
     Your larders, too, so hung with meat,
     That though a thousand, thousand eat,

     Yet, ere twelve moons shall whirl about
     Their silv'ry spheres, there's none may doubt
     But more's sent in than was served out.

     Next, may your dairies prosper so,
     As that your pans no ebb may know;
     But if they do, the more to flow,

     Like to a solemn sober stream,
     Bank'd all with lilies, and the cream
     Of sweetest cowslips filling them.

     Then may your plants be press'd with fruit,
     Nor bee or hive you have be mute,
     But sweetly sounding like a lute.

     Last, may your harrows, shares, and ploughs,
     Your stacks, your stocks, your sweetest mows,
     All prosper by your virgin-vows.

     &mdash;Alas!  we bless, but see none here,
     That brings us either ale or beer;
     In a dry-house all things are near.

     Let's leave a longer time to wait,
     Where rust and cobwebs bind the gate;
     And all live here with needy fate;

     Where chimneys do for ever weep
     For want of warmth, and stomachs keep
     With noise the servants' eyes from sleep.

     It is in vain to sing, or stay
     Our free feet here, but we'll away:
     Yet to the Lares this we'll say:

     'The time will come when you'll be sad,
     'And reckon this for fortune bad,
     'T'ave lost the good ye might have had.'

     Let box now domineer,
     Until the dancing Easter-day,
     Or Easter's eve appear.

     Then youthful box, which now hath grace
     Your houses to renew,
     Grown old, surrender must his place
     Unto the crisped yew.

     When yew is out, then birch comes in,
     And many flowers beside,
     Both of a fresh and fragrant kin,
     To honour Whitsuntide.

     Green rushes then, and sweetest bents,
     With cooler oaken boughs,

      25. CORINA'S GOING A MAYING
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Get up, get up for shame!  the blooming morn
     Upon her wings presents the god unshorn.
     See how Aurora throws her fair
     Fresh-quilted colours through the air:
     Get up, sweet-slug-a-bed, and see
     The dew bespangling herb and tree.
     Each flower has wept, and bow'd toward the east,
     Above an hour since; yet you not drest,
     Nay!  not so much as out of bed?
     When all the birds have matins said,
     And sung their thankful hymns:  'tis sin,
     Nay, profanation, to keep in,&mdash;
     Whenas a thousand virgins on this day,
     Spring, sooner than the lark, to fetch in May.

     Rise; and put on your foliage, and be seen
     To come forth, like the Spring-time, fresh and green,
     And sweet as Flora.  Take no care
     For jewels for your gown, or hair:
     Fear not; the leaves will strew
     Gems in abundance upon you:
     Besides, the childhood of the day has kept,
     Against you come, some orient pearls unwept:
     Come, and receive them while the light
     Hangs on the dew-locks of the night:
     And Titan on the eastern hill
     Retires himself, or else stands still
     Till you come forth.  Wash, dress, be brief in praying:
     Few beads are best, when once we go a Maying.

     Come, my Corinna, come; and coming, mark
     How each field turns a street; each street a park
     Made green, and trimm'd with trees:  see how
     Devotion gives each house a bough
     Or branch:  each porch, each door, ere this,
     An ark, a tabernacle is
     Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove;
     As if here were those cooler shades of love.
     Can such delights be in the street,
     And open fields, and we not see't?
     Come, we'll abroad:  and let's obey
     The proclamation made for May:
     And sin no more, as we have done, by staying;
     But, my Corinna, come, let's go a Maying.

     There's not a budding boy, or girl, this day,
     But is got up, and gone to bring in May.
     A deal of youth, ere this, is come
     Back, and with white-thorn laden home.
     Some have dispatch'd their cakes and cream,
     Before that we have left to dream:
     And some have wept, and woo'd, and plighted troth,
     And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:
     Many a green-gown has been given;
     Many a kiss, both odd and even:
     Many a glance, too, has been sent
     From out the eye, love's firmament:
     Many a jest told of the keys betraying
     This night, and locks pick'd:&mdash;yet we're not a Maying.

     &mdash;Come, let us go, while we are in our prime;
     And take the harmless folly of the time!
     We shall grow old apace, and die
     Before we know our liberty.
     Our life is short; and our days run
     As fast away as does the sun:&mdash;
     And as a vapour, or a drop of rain
     Once lost, can ne'er be found again:
     So when or you or I are made
     A fable, song, or fleeting shade;
     All love, all liking, all delight
     Lies drown'd with us in endless night.
     &mdash;Then while time serves, and we are but decaying,
     Come, my Corinna!  come, let's go a Maying.

     And a mimic to devise
     Many grinning properties.
     Players there will be, and those
     Base in action as in clothes;
     Yet with strutting they will please
     The incurious villages.
     Near the dying of the day
     There will be a cudgel-play,
     Where a coxcomb will be broke,

     But the anger ends all here,
     Drench'd in ale, or drown'd in beer.

      28. THE HOCK-CART, OR HARVEST HOME: TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MILDMAY, EARL
      OF WESTMORLAND
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Come, Sons of Summer, by whose toil
     We are the lords of wine and oil:
     By whose tough labours, and rough hands,
     We rip up first, then reap our lands.
     Crown'd with the ears of corn, now come,
     And, to the pipe, sing Harvest Home.

     Come forth, my lord, and see the cart
     Drest up with all the country art.
     See, here a maukin, there a sheet,
     As spotless pure, as it is sweet:
     The horses, mares, and frisking fillies,
     Clad, all, in linen white as lilies.
     The harvest swains and wenches bound
     For joy, to see the Hock-Cart crown'd.
     About the cart, hear, how the rout
     Of rural younglings raise the shout;
     Pressing before, some coming after,
     Those with a shout, and these with laughter.
     Some bless the cart; some kiss the sheaves;
     Some prank them up with oaken leaves:
     Some cross the fill-horse; some with great
     Devotion, stroke the home-borne wheat:
     While other rustics, less attent
     To prayers, than to merriment,
     Run after with their breeches rent.
     &mdash;Well, on, brave boys, to your lord's hearth,
     Glitt'ring with fire; where, for your mirth,
     Ye shall see first the large and chief
     Foundation of your feast, fat beef;
     With upper stories, mutton, veal
     And bacon, which makes full the meal,
     With sev'ral dishes standing by,
     As here a custard, there a pie,
     And here, all tempting frumenty.
     And for to make the merry cheer,
     If smirking wine be wanting here,
     There's that which drowns all care, stout beer:
     Which freely drink to your lord's health
     Then to the plough, the common-wealth;
     Next to your flails, your fanes, your vats;
     Then to the maids with wheaten hats:
     To the rough sickle, and crookt scythe,&mdash;
     Drink, frolic, boys, till all be blythe.
     Feed, and grow fat; and as ye eat,
     Be mindful, that the lab'ring neat,
     As you, may have their fill of meat.
     And know, besides, ye must revoke
     The patient ox unto the yoke,
     And all go back unto the plough
     And harrow, though they're hang'd up now.
     And, you must know, your lord's word's true,
     Feed him ye must, whose food fills you;
     And that this pleasure is like rain,
     Not sent ye for to drown your pain,
     But for to make it spring again.

      34. A PASTORAL UPON THE BIRTH OF PRINCE CHARLES: PRESENTED TO THE KING,
      AND SET BY MR NIC. LANIERE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     THE SPEAKERS: MIRTILLO, AMINTAS, AND AMARILLIS

     AMIN. Good day, Mirtillo.  MIRT. And to you no less;
     And all fair signs lead on our shepherdess.
     AMAR. With all white luck to you.  MIRT. But say,
     What news
     Stirs in our sheep-walk?  AMIN. None, save that my
     ewes,
     My wethers, lambs, and wanton kids are well,
     Smooth, fair, and fat; none better I can tell:
     Or that this day Menalchas keeps a feast
     For his sheep-shearers.  MIRT. True, these are the least.
     But dear Amintas, and sweet Amarillis,
     Rest but a while here by this bank of lilies;
     And lend a gentle ear to one report
     The country has.  AMIN. From whence?  AMAR. From
     whence?  MIRT. The Court.
     Three days before the shutting-in of May,
     (With whitest wool be ever crown'd that day!)
     To all our joy, a sweet-faced child was born,
     More tender than the childhood of the morn.
     CHORUS:&mdash;Pan pipe to him, and bleats of lambs and
     sheep
     Let lullaby the pretty prince asleep!
     MIRT. And that his birth should be more singular,
     At noon of day was seen a silver star,
     Bright as the wise men's torch, which guided them
     To God's sweet babe, when born at Bethlehem;
     While golden angels, some have told to me,
     Sung out his birth with heav'nly minstrelsy.
     AMIN. O rare!  But is't a trespass, if we three
     Should wend along his baby-ship to see?
     MIRT. Not so, not so.  CHOR. But if it chance to prove
     At most a fault, 'tis but a fault of love.
     AMAR.  But, dear Mirtillo, I have heard it told,
     Those learned men brought incense, myrrh, and gold,
     From countries far, with store of spices sweet,
     And laid them down for offerings at his feet.
     MIRT. 'Tis true, indeed; and each of us will bring
     Unto our smiling and our blooming King,
     A neat, though not so great an offering.
     AMAR.  A garland for my gift shall be,
     Of flowers ne'er suck'd by th' thieving bee;
     And all most sweet, yet all less sweet than he.
     AMIN. And I will bear along with you
     Leaves dropping down the honied dew,
     With oaten pipes, as sweet, as new.
     MIRT. And I a sheep-hook will bestow
     To have his little King-ship know,
     As he is Prince, he's Shepherd too.
     CHOR. Come, let's away, and quickly let's be drest,
     And quickly give:&mdash;the swiftest grace is best.
     And when before him we have laid our treasures,
     We'll bless the babe:&mdash;then back to country pleasures.

     My dearest Love, since thou wilt go,
     And leave me here behind thee;
     For love or pity, let me know
     The place where I may find thee.

     AMARIL.  In country meadows, pearl'd with dew,
     And set about with lilies;
     There, filling maunds with cowslips, you
     May find your Amarillis.

     HER.  What have the meads to do with thee,
     Or with thy youthful hours?
     Live thou at court, where thou mayst be
     The queen of men, not flowers.

     Let country wenches make 'em fine
     With posies, since 'tis fitter
     For thee with richest gems to shine,
     And like the stars to glitter.

     AMARIL.  You set too-high a rate upon
     A shepherdess so homely.
     HER.  Believe it, dearest, there's not one
     I' th' court that's half so comely.

     I prithee stay.  AMARIL.  I must away;
     Let's kiss first, then we'll sever;
     AMBO  And though we bid adieu to day,
     We shall not part for ever.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     LACON.  For a kiss or two, confess,
     What doth cause this pensiveness,
     Thou most lovely neat-herdess?
     Why so lonely on the hill?
     Why thy pipe by thee so still,
     That erewhile was heard so shrill?
     Tell me, do thy kine now fail
     To fulfil the milking-pail?
     Say, what is't that thou dost ail?

     THYR.  None of these; but out, alas!
     A mischance is come to pass,
     And I'll tell thee what it was:
     See, mine eyes are weeping ripe.
     LACON.  Tell, and I'll lay down my pipe.

     THYR.  I have lost my lovely steer,
     That to me was far more dear
     Than these kine which I milk here;
     Broad of forehead, large of eye,
     Party-colour'd like a pye,
     Smooth in each limb as a die;
     Clear of hoof, and clear of horn,
     Sharply pointed as a thorn;
     With a neck by yoke unworn,
     From the which hung down by strings,
     Balls of cowslips, daisy rings,
     Interplaced with ribbonings;
     Faultless every way for shape;
     Not a straw could him escape,
     Ever gamesome as an ape,
     But yet harmless as a sheep.
     Pardon, Lacon, if I weep;
     Tears will spring where woes are deep.
     Now, ai me!  ai me!  Last night
     Came a mad dog, and did bite,
     Ay, and kill'd my dear delight.

     LACON  Alack, for grief!
     THYR.  But I'll be brief.
     Hence I must, for time doth call
     Me, and my sad playmates all,
     To his evening funeral.
     Live long, Lacon; so adieu!

     LACON Mournful maid, farewell to you;
     Earth afford ye flowers to strew!

     MONTANO, SILVIO, AND MIRTILLO, SHEPHERDS

     MON.  Bad are the times.  SIL.  And worse than they are we.
     MON.  Troth, bad are both; worse fruit, and ill the tree:
     The feast of shepherds fail.  SIL.  None crowns the cup
     Of wassail now, or sets the quintel up:
     And he, who used to lead the country-round,
     Youthful Mirtillo, here he comes, grief-drown'd.
     AMBO.  Let's cheer him up.  SIL. Behold him weeping-ripe.
     MIRT. Ah, Amarillis!  farewell mirth and pipe;
     Since thou art gone, no more I mean to play
     To these smooth lawns, my mirthful roundelay.
     Dear Amarillis!  MON.  Hark!  SIL.  Mark!  MIRT.  This
     earth grew sweet
     Where, Amarillis, thou didst set thy feet.
     AMBO  Poor pitied youth!  MIRT.  And here the breath
     of kine
     And sheep grew more sweet by that breath of thine.
     This dock of wool, and this rich lock of hair,
     This ball of cowslips, these she gave me here.
     SIL.  Words sweet as love itself.  MON.  Hark!&mdash;
     MIRT.  This way she came, and this way too she went;
     How each thing smells divinely redolent!
     Like to a field of beans, when newly blown,
     Or like a meadow being lately mown.
     MON.  A sweet sad passion&mdash;&mdash;
     MIRT.  In dewy mornings, when she came this way,
     Sweet bents would bow, to give my Love the day;
     And when at night she folded had her sheep,
     Daisies would shut, and closing, sigh and weep.
     Besides (Ai me!) since she went hence to dwell,
     The Voice's Daughter ne'er spake syllable.
     But she is gone.  SIL.  Mirtillo, tell us whither?
     MIRT.  Where she and I shall never meet together.
     MON.  Fore-fend it, Pan!  and Pales, do thou please
     To give an end...  MIRT.  To what?  SIL.  Such griefs
     as these.
     MIRT.  Never, O never!  Still I may endure
     The wound I suffer, never find a cure.
     MON.  Love, for thy sake, will bring her to these hills
     And dales again.  MIRT.  No, I will languish still;
     And all the while my part shall be to weep;
     And with my sighs call home my bleating sheep;
     And in the rind of every comely tree
     I'll carve thy name, and in that name kiss thee.
     MON.  Set with the sun, thy woes!  SIL.  The day
     grows old;
     And time it is our full-fed flocks to fold.
     CHOR.  The shades grow great; but greater grows
     our sorrow:&mdash;
     But let's go steep

     To-morrow.

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     DEDICATED TO MR JOHN MERRIFIELD,
     COUNSELLOR AT LAW

     RARE TEMPLES THOU HAST SEEN, I KNOW,
     AND RICH FOR IN AND OUTWARD SHOW;
     SURVEY THIS CHAPEL BUILT, ALONE,
     WITHOUT OR LIME, OR WOOD, OR STONE.
     THEN SAY, IF ONE THOU'ST SEEN MORE FINE
     THAN THIS, THE FAIRIES' ONCE, NOW THINE.

     THE TEMPLE

     A way enchaced with glass and beads
     There is, that to the Chapel leads;
     Whose structure, for his holy rest,
     Is here the Halcyon's curious nest;
     Into the which who looks, shall see
     His Temple of Idolatry;
     Where he of god-heads has such store,
     As Rome's Pantheon had not more.
     His house of Rimmon this he calls,
     Girt with small bones, instead of walls.
     First in a niche, more black than jet,
     His idol-cricket there is set;
     Then in a polish'd oval by
     There stands his idol-beetle-fly;
     Next, in an arch, akin to this,
     His idol-canker seated is.
     Then in a round, is placed by these
     His golden god, Cantharides.
     So that where'er ye look, ye see
     No capital, no cornice free,
     Or frieze, from this fine frippery.
     Now this the Fairies would have known,
     Theirs is a mixt religion:
     And some have heard the elves it call
     Part Pagan, part Papistical.
     If unto me all tongues were granted,
     I could not speak the saints here painted.
     Saint Tit, Saint Nit, Saint Is, Saint Itis,
     Who 'gainst Mab's state placed here right is.
     Saint Will o' th' Wisp, of no great bigness,
     But, alias, call'd here FATUUS IGNIS.
     Saint Frip, Saint Trip, Saint Fill, Saint Filly;&mdash;
     Neither those other saint-ships will I
     Here go about for to recite
     Their number, almost infinite;
     Which, one by one, here set down are
     In this most curious calendar.

     First, at the entrance of the gate,
     A little puppet-priest doth wait,
     Who squeaks to all the comers there,
     'Favour your tongues, who enter here.
     'Pure hands bring hither, without stain.'
     A second pules, 'Hence, hence, profane!'
     Hard by, i' th' shell of half a nut,
     The holy-water there is put;
     A little brush of squirrels' hairs,
     Composed of odd, not even pairs,
     Stands in the platter, or close by,
     To purge the fairy family.
     Near to the altar stands the priest,
     There offering up the holy-grist;
     Ducking in mood and perfect tense,
     With (much good do't him) reverence.
     The altar is not here four-square,
     Nor in a form triangular;
     Nor made of glass, or wood, or stone,
     But of a little transverse bone;
     Which boys and bruckel'd children call
     (Playing for points and pins) cockall.
     Whose linen-drapery is a thin,
     Subtile, and ductile codling's skin;
     Which o'er the board is smoothly spread
     With little seal-work damasked.
     The fringe that circumbinds it, too,
     Is spangle-work of trembling dew,
     Which, gently gleaming, makes a show,
     Like frost-work glitt'ring on the snow.
     Upon this fetuous board doth stand
     Something for shew-bread, and at hand
     (Just in the middle of the altar)
     Upon an end, the Fairy-psalter,
     Graced with the trout-flies' curious wings,
     Which serve for watchet ribbonings.
     Now, we must know, the elves are led
     Right by the Rubric, which they read:
     And if report of them be true,
     They have their text for what they do;
     Ay, and their book of canons too.
     And, as Sir Thomas Parson tells,
     They have their book of articles;
     And if that Fairy knight not lies
     They have their book of homilies;
     And other Scriptures, that design
     A short, but righteous discipline.
     The bason stands the board upon
     To take the free-oblation;
     A little pin-dust, which they hold
     More precious than we prize our gold;
     Which charity they give to many
     Poor of the parish, if there's any.
     Upon the ends of these neat rails,
     Hatch'd with the silver-light of snails,
     The elves, in formal manner, fix
     Two pure and holy candlesticks,
     In either which a tall small bent
     Burns for the altar's ornament.
     For sanctity, they have, to these,
     Their curious copes and surplices
     Of cleanest cobweb, hanging by
     In their religious vestery.
     They have their ash-pans and their brooms,
     To purge the chapel and the rooms;
     Their many mumbling mass-priests here,
     And many a dapper chorister.
     Their ush'ring vergers here likewise,
     Their canons and their chaunteries;
     Of cloister-monks they have enow,
     Ay, and their abbey-lubbers too:&mdash;
     And if their legend do not lie,
     They much affect the papacy;
     And since the last is dead, there's hope
     Elve Boniface shall next be Pope.
     They have their cups and chalices,
     Their pardons and indulgences,
     Their beads of nits, bells, books, and wax-
     Candles, forsooth, and other knacks;
     Their holy oil, their fasting-spittle,
     Their sacred salt here, not a little.
     Dry chips, old shoes, rags, grease, and bones,
     Beside their fumigations.
     Many a trifle, too, and trinket,
     And for what use, scarce man would think it.
     Next then, upon the chanter's side
     An apple's-core is hung up dried,
     With rattling kernels, which is rung
     To call to morn and even-song.
     The saint, to which the most he prays
     And offers incense nights and days,
     The lady of the lobster is,
     Whose foot-pace he doth stroke and kiss,
     And, humbly, chives of saffron brings
     For his most cheerful offerings.
     When, after these, he's paid his vows,
     He lowly to the altar bows;
     And then he dons the silk-worm's shed,
     Like a Turk's turban on his head,
     And reverently departeth thence,
     Hid in a cloud of frankincense;
     And by the glow-worm's light well guided,
     Goes to the Feast that's now provided.

      40. OBERON'S FEAST
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SHAPCOT!  TO THE THE FAIRY STATE
     I WITH DISCRETION DEDICATE:
     BECAUSE THOU PRIZEST THINGS THAT ARE
     CURIOUS AND UNFAMILIAR.
     TAKE FIRST THE FEAST; THESE DISHES GONE,
     WE'LL SEE THE FAIRY COURT ANON.

     A little mushroom-table spread,
     After short prayers, they set on bread,
     A moon-parch'd grain of purest wheat,
     With some small glitt'ring grit, to eat
     His choice bits with; then in a trice
     They make a feast less great than nice.
     But all this while his eye is served,
     We must not think his ear was sterved;
     But that there was in place to stir
     His spleen, the chirring grasshopper,
     The merry cricket, puling fly,
     The piping gnat for minstrelsy.
     And now, we must imagine first,
     The elves present, to quench his thirst,
     A pure seed-pearl of infant dew,
     Brought and besweeten'd in a blue
     And pregnant violet; which done,
     His kitling eyes begin to run
     Quite through the table, where he spies
     The horns of papery butterflies,
     Of which he eats; and tastes a little
     Of that we call the cuckoo's spittle;
     A little fuz-ball pudding stands
     By, yet not blessed by his hands,
     That was too coarse; but then forthwith
     He ventures boldly on the pith
     Of sugar'd rush, and eats the sagge
     And well-bestrutted bees' sweet bag;
     Gladding his palate with some store
     Of emmets' eggs; what would he more?
     But beards of mice, a newt's stew'd thigh,
     A bloated earwig, and a fly;
     With the red-capt worm, that's shut
     Within the concave of a nut,
     Brown as his tooth.  A little moth,
     Late fatten'd in a piece of cloth;
     With wither'd cherries, mandrakes' ears,
     Moles' eyes:  to these the slain stag's tears;
     The unctuous dewlaps of a snail,
     The broke-heart of a nightingale
     O'ercome in music; with a wine
     Ne'er ravish'd from the flattering vine,
     But gently prest from the soft side
     Of the most sweet and dainty bride,
     Brought in a dainty daisy, which
     He fully quaffs up, to bewitch
     His blood to height; this done, commended
     Grace by his priest; The feast is ended.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Please your Grace, from out your store
     Give an alms to one that's poor,
     That your mickle may have more.
     Black I'm grown for want of meat,
     Give me then an ant to eat,
     Or the cleft ear of a mouse
     Over-sour'd in drink of souce;
     Or, sweet lady, reach to me
     The abdomen of a bee;
     Or commend a cricket's hip,
     Or his huckson, to my scrip;
     Give for bread, a little bit
     Of a pease that 'gins to chit,
     And my full thanks take for it.
     Flour of fuz-balls, that's too good
     For a man in needy-hood;
     But the meal of mill-dust can
     Well content a craving man;
     Any orts the elves refuse
     Well will serve the beggar's use.
     But if this may seem too much
     For an alms, then give me such
     Little bits that nestle there
     In the pris'ner's pannier.
     So a blessing light upon
     You, and mighty Oberon;
     That your plenty last till when
     I return your alms again.

     Through thick and through thin,
     Now out, and then in,
     Though ne'er so foul be the weather.

     A thorn or a bur
     She takes for a spur;
     With a lash of a bramble she rides now,
     Through brakes and through briars,
     O'er ditches and mires,
     She follows the spirit that guides now.

     No beast, for his food,
     Dares now range the wood,
     But hush'd in his lair he lies lurking;
     While mischiefs, by these,
     On land and on seas,
     At noon of night are a-working.

     The storm will arise,
     And trouble the skies
     This night; and, more for the wonder,

     Affrighted shall come,
     Call'd out by the clap of the thunder.

      44. THE CHEAT OF CUPID; OR, THE UNGENTLE GUEST
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One silent night of late,
     When every creature rested,
     Came one unto my gate,
     And knocking, me molested.

     Who's that, said I, beats there,
     And troubles thus the sleepy?
     Cast off; said he, all fear,
     And let not locks thus keep ye.

     For I a boy am, who
     By moonless nights have swerved;
     And all with showers wet through,
     And e'en with cold half starved.

     I pitiful arose,
     And soon a taper lighted;
     And did myself disclose
     Unto the lad benighted.

     I saw he had a bow,
     And wings too, which did shiver;
     And looking down below,
     I spied he had a quiver.

     I to my chimney's shine
     Brought him, as Love professes,
     And chafed his hands with mine,
     And dried his dropping tresses.

     But when he felt him warm'd,
     Let's try this bow of ours
     And string, if they be harm'd,
     Said he, with these late showers.

     Forthwith his bow he bent,
     And wedded string and arrow,
     And struck me, that it went
     Quite through my heart and marrow

     Then laughing loud, he flew
     Away, and thus said flying,
     Adieu, mine host, adieu,
     I'll leave thy heart a-dying.

     He saw my palm; and then, said he,
     I tell thee, by this score here,
     That thou, within few months, shalt be
     The youthful Prince D'Amour here.

     I smiled, and bade him once more prove,

     An Indian commonwealth.

     A goblet next I'll drink
     To Ovid; and suppose
     Made he the pledge, he'd think
     The world had all one nose.

     Then this immensive cup
     Of aromatic wine,
     Catullus!  I quaff up
     To that terse muse of thine.

     Wild I am now with heat:
     O Bacchus!  cool thy rays;
     Or frantic I shall eat
     Thy Thyrse, and bite the Bays!

     Round, round, the roof does run;
     And being ravish'd thus,
     Come, I will drink a tun
     To my Propertius.

     Now, to Tibullus next,
     This flood I drink to thee;
     &mdash;But stay, I see a text,
     That this presents to me.

     Behold!  Tibullus lies
     Here burnt, whose small return
     Of ashes scarce suffice
     To fill a little urn.

     Trust to good verses then;
     They only will aspire,
     When pyramids, as men,
     Are lost i' th' funeral fire.

     And when all bodies meet
     In Lethe to be drown'd;
     Then only numbers sweet
     With endless life are crown'd.

      55. THE APPARITION OF HIS, MISTRESS, CALLING HIM TO ELYSIUM
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     DESUNT NONNULLA&mdash;

     Come then, and like two doves with silvery wings,
     Let our souls fly to th' shades, wherever springs
     Sit smiling in the meads; where balm and oil,
     Roses and cassia, crown the untill'd soil;
     Where no disease reigns, or infection comes
     To blast the air, but amber-gris and gums.
     This, that, and ev'ry thicket doth transpire
     More sweet than storax from the hallow'd fire;
     Where ev'ry tree a wealthy issue bears
     Of fragrant apples, blushing plums, or pears;
     And all the shrubs, with sparkling spangles, shew
     Like morning sun-shine, tinselling the dew.
     Here in green meadows sits eternal May,
     Purfling the margents, while perpetual day
     So double-gilds the air, as that no night
     Can ever rust th' enamel of the light:
     Here naked younglings, handsome striplings, run
     Their goals for virgins' kisses; which when done,
     Then unto dancing forth the learned round
     Commix'd they meet, with endless roses crown'd.
     And here we'll sit on primrose-banks, and see
     Love's chorus led by Cupid; and we'll he
     Two loving followers too unto the grove,
     Where poets sing the stories of our love.
     There thou shalt hear divine Musaeus sing
     Of Hero and Leander; then I'll bring
     Thee to the stand, where honour'd Homer reads
     His Odyssees and his high Iliads;
     About whose throne the crowd of poets throng
     To hear the incantation of his tongue:
     To Linus, then to Pindar; and that done,
     I'll bring thee, Herrick, to Anacreon,
     Quaffing his full-crown'd bowls of burning wine,
     And in his raptures speaking lines of thine,
     Like to his subject; and as his frantic
     Looks shew him truly Bacchanalian like,
     Besmear'd with grapes,&mdash;welcome he shall thee thither,
     Where both may rage, both drink and dance together.
     Then stately Virgil, witty Ovid, by
     Whom fair Corinna sits, and doth comply
     With ivory wrists his laureat head, and steeps
     His eye in dew of kisses while he sleeps.
     Then soft Catullus, sharp-fang'd Martial,
     And towering Lucan, Horace, Juvenal,
     And snaky Persius; these, and those whom rage,
     Dropt for the jars of heaven, fill'd, t' engage
     All times unto their frenzies; thou shalt there
     Behold them in a spacious theatre:
     Among which glories, crown'd with sacred bays
     And flatt'ring ivy, two recite their plays,
     Beaumont and Fletcher, swans, to whom all ears
     Listen, while they, like sirens in their spheres,
     Sing their Evadne; and still more for thee
     There yet remains to know than thou canst see
     By glimm'ring of a fancy; Do but come,
     And there I'll shew thee that capacious room
     In which thy father, Jonson, now is placed
     As in a globe of radiant fire, and graced
     To be in that orb crown'd, that doth include
     Those prophets of the former magnitude,
     And he one chief.  But hark!  I hear the cock,
     The bell-man of the night, proclaim the clock
     Of late struck One; and now I see the prime
     Of day break from the pregnant east:&mdash;'tis time
     I vanish:&mdash;more I had to say,
     But night determines here; Away!

      56. THE INVITATION
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To sup with thee thou didst me home invite,
     And mad'st a promise that mine appetite
     Should meet and tire, on such lautitious meat,
     The like not Heliogabalus did eat:
     And richer wine would'st give to me, thy guest,
     Than Roman Sylla pour'd out at his feast.
     I came, 'tis true, and look'd for fowl of price,
     The bastard Phoenix; bird of Paradise;
     And for no less than aromatic wine
     Of maidens-blush, commix'd with jessamine.
     Clean was the hearth, the mantle larded jet,
     Which, wanting Lar and smoke, hung weeping wet;
     At last i' th' noon of winter, did appear
     A ragg'd soused neats-foot, with sick vinegar;
     And in a burnish'd flagonet, stood by
     Beer small as comfort, dead as charity.
     At which amazed, and pond'ring on the food,
     How cold it was, and how it chill'd my blood,
     I curst the master, and I damn'd the souce,

    <h2>
      58. A COUNTRY LIFE: TO HIS BROTHER, MR THOMAS HERRICK
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Thrice, and above, blest, my soul's half, art thou,
     In thy both last and better vow;
     Could'st leave the city, for exchange, to see
     The country's sweet simplicity;
     And it to know and practise, with intent
     To grow the sooner innocent;
     By studying to know virtue, and to aim
     More at her nature than her name;
     The last is but the least; the first doth tell
     Ways less to live, than to live well:&mdash;
     And both are known to thee, who now canst live
     Led by thy conscience, to give
     Justice to soon-pleased nature, and to show
     Wisdom and she together go,
     And keep one centre; This with that conspires
     To teach man to confine desires,
     And know that riches have their proper stint
     In the contented mind, not mint;
     And canst instruct that those who have the itch
     Of craving more, are never rich.
     These things thou knows't to th' height, and dost prevent
     That plague, because thou art content
     With that Heaven gave thee with a wary hand,
     (More blessed in thy brass than land)
     To keep cheap Nature even and upright;
     To cool, not cocker appetite.
     Thus thou canst tersely live to satisfy
     The belly chiefly, not the eye;
     Keeping the barking stomach wisely quiet,
     Less with a neat than needful diet.
     But that which most makes sweet thy country life,
     Is the fruition of a wife,
     Whom, stars consenting with thy fate, thou hast
     Got not so beautiful as chaste;
     By whose warm side thou dost securely sleep,
     While Love the sentinel doth keep,
     With those deeds done by day, which ne'er affright
     Thy silken slumbers in the night:
     Nor has the darkness power to usher in
     Fear to those sheets that know no sin.
     The damask'd meadows and the pebbly streams
     Sweeten and make soft your dreams:
     The purling springs, groves, birds, and well weaved bowers,
     With fields enamelled with flowers,
     Present their shapes, while fantasy discloses
     Millions of Lilies mix'd with Roses.
     Then dream, ye hear the lamb by many a bleat
     Woo'd to come suck the milky teat;
     While Faunus in the vision comes, to keep
     From rav'ning wolves the fleecy sheep:
     With thousand such enchanting dreams, that meet
     To make sleep not so sound as sweet;
     Nor call these figures so thy rest endear,
     As not to rise when Chanticlere
     Warns the last watch;&mdash;but with the dawn dost rise
     To work, but first to sacrifice;
     Making thy peace with Heaven for some late fault,
     With holy-meal and spirting salt;
     Which done, thy painful thumb this sentence tells us,
     'Jove for our labour all things sells us.'
     Nor are thy daily and devout affairs
     Attended with those desp'rate cares
     Th' industrious merchant has, who for to find
     Gold, runneth to the Western Ind,
     And back again, tortured with fears, doth fly,
     Untaught to suffer Poverty;&mdash;
     But thou at home, blest with securest ease,
     Sitt'st, and believ'st that there be seas,
     And watery dangers; while thy whiter hap
     But sees these things within thy map;
     And viewing them with a more safe survey,
     Mak'st easy fear unto thee say,
     'A heart thrice walled with oak and brass, that man
     Had, first durst plough the ocean.'
     But thou at home, without or tide or gale,
     Canst in thy map securely sail;
     Seeing those painted countries, and so guess
     By those fine shades, their substances;
     And from thy compass taking small advice,
     Buy'st travel at the lowest price.
     Nor are thine ears so deaf but thou canst hear,
     Far more with wonder than with fear,
     Fame tell of states, of countries, courts, and kings,
     And believe there be such things;
     When of these truths thy happier knowledge lies
     More in thine ears than in thine eyes.
     And when thou hear'st by that too true report,
     Vice rules the most, or all, at court,
     Thy pious wishes are, though thou not there,
     Virtue had, and moved her sphere.
     But thou liv'st fearless; and thy face ne'er shows
     Fortune when she comes, or goes;
     But with thy equal thoughts, prepared dost stand
     To take her by the either hand;
     Nor car'st which comes the first, the foul or fair:&mdash;
     A wise man ev'ry way lies square;
     And like a surly oak with storms perplex'd
     Grows still the stronger, strongly vex'd.
     Be so, bold Spirit; stand centre-like, unmoved;
     And be not only thought, but proved
     To be what I report thee, and inure
     Thyself, if want comes, to endure;
     And so thou dost; for thy desires are
     Confined to live with private Lar:
     Nor curious whether appetite be fed
     Or with the first, or second bread.
     Who keep'st no proud mouth for delicious cates;
     Hunger makes coarse meats, delicates.
     Canst, and unurged, forsake that larded fare,
     Which art, not nature, makes so rare;
     To taste boil'd nettles, coleworts, beets, and eat
     These, and sour herbs, as dainty meat:&mdash;
     While soft opinion makes thy Genius say,
     'Content makes all ambrosia;'
     Nor is it that thou keep'st this stricter size
     So much for want, as exercise;
     To numb the sense of dearth, which, should sin haste it,
     Thou might'st but only see't, not taste it;
     Yet can thy humble roof maintain a quire
     Of singing crickets by thy fire;
     And the brisk mouse may feast herself with crumbs,
     Till that the green-eyed kitling comes;
     Then to her cabin, blest she can escape
     The sudden danger of a rape.
     &mdash;And thus thy little well-kept stock doth prove,
     Wealth cannot make a life, but love.
     Nor art thou so close-handed, but canst spend,
     (Counsel concurring with the end),
     As well as spare; still conning o'er this theme,
     To shun the first and last extreme;
     Ordaining that thy small stock find no breach,
     Or to exceed thy tether's reach;
     But to live round, and close, and wisely true
     To thine own self, and known to few.
     Thus let thy rural sanctuary be
     Elysium to thy wife and thee;
     There to disport your selves with golden measure;
     For seldom use commends the pleasure.
     Live, and live blest; thrice happy pair; let breath,
     But lost to one, be th' other's death:
     And as there is one love, one faith, one troth,
     Be so one death, one grave to both;
     Till when, in such assurance live, ye may
     Nor fear, or wish your dying day.

      60. A PARANAETICALL, OR ADVISIVE VERSE TO HIS FRIEND, MR JOHN WICKS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Is this a life, to break thy sleep,
     To rise as soon as day doth peep?
     To tire thy patient ox or ass
     By noon, and let thy good days pass,
     Not knowing this, that Jove decrees
     Some mirth, t' adulce man's miseries?
     &mdash;No; 'tis a life to have thine oil
     Without extortion from thy soil;
     Thy faithful fields to yield thee grain,
     Although with some, yet little pain;
     To have thy mind, and nuptial bed,
     With fears and cares uncumbered
     A pleasing wife, that by thy side
     Lies softly panting like a bride;
     &mdash;This is to live, and to endear
     Those minutes Time has lent us here.
     Then, while fates suffer, live thou free,
     As is that air that circles thee;
     And crown thy temples too; and let
     Thy servant, not thy own self, sweat,
     To strut thy barns with sheaves of wheat.
     &mdash;Time steals away like to a stream,
     And we glide hence away with them:
     No sound recalls the hours once fled,
     Or roses, being withered;
     Nor us, my friend, when we are lost,
     Like to a dew, or melted frost.
     &mdash;Then live we mirthful while we should,
     And turn the iron age to gold;
     Let's feast and frolic, sing and play,
     And thus less last, than live our day.

     Whose life with care is overcast,

     Sit crown'd with rose-buds, and carouse,
     Till LIBER PATER twirls the house

     And let the russet swains the plough
     And harrow hang up resting now;

      63. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSBY CREW

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Here we securely live, and eat
     The cream of meat;
     And keep eternal fires,
     By which we sit, and do divine,
     As wine
     And rage inspires.

     If full, we charm; then call upon
     Anacreon
     To grace the frantic Thyrse:
     And having drunk, we raise a shout
     Throughout,
     To praise his verse.

     Then cause we Horace to be read,
     Which sung or said,
     A goblet, to the brim,
     Of lyric wine, both swell'd and crown'd,
     Around
     We quaff to him.

     Thus, thus we live, and spend the hours
     In wine and flowers;
     And make the frolic year,
     The month, the week, the instant day
     To stay
     The longer here.

     &mdash;Come then, brave Knight, and see the cell
     Wherein I dwell;
     And my enchantments too;
     Which love and noble freedom is:&mdash;
     And this
     Shall fetter you.

     Take horse, and come; or be so kind
     To send your mind,
     Though but in numbers few:&mdash;
     And I shall think I have the heart

      64. A PANEGYRIC TO SIR LEWIS PEMBERTON
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Till I shall come again, let this suffice,
     I send my salt, my sacrifice
     To thee, thy lady, younglings, and as far
     As to thy Genius and thy Lar;
     To the worn threshold, porch, hall, parlour, kitchen,
     The fat-fed smoking temple, which in
     The wholesome savour of thy mighty chines,
     Invites to supper him who dines:
     Where laden spits, warp'd with large ribs of beef,
     Not represent, but give relief
     To the lank stranger and the sour swain,
     Where both may feed and come again;
     For no black-bearded Vigil from thy door
     Beats with a button'd-staff the poor;
     But from thy warm love-hatching gates, each may
     Take friendly morsels, and there stay
     To sun his thin-clad members, if he likes;
     For thou no porter keep'st who strikes.
     No comer to thy roof his guest-rite wants;
     Or, staying there, is scourged with taunts
     Of some rough groom, who, yirk'd with corns, says, 'Sir,
     'You've dipp'd too long i' th' vinegar;
     'And with our broth and bread and bits, Sir friend,
     'You've fared well; pray make an end;
     'Two days you've larded here; a third, ye know,
     'Makes guests and fish smell strong; pray go
     'You to some other chimney, and there take
     'Essay of other giblets; make
     'Merry at another's hearth; you're here
     'Welcome as thunder to our beer;
     'Manners knows distance, and a man unrude
     'Would soon recoil, and not intrude
     'His stomach to a second meal.'&mdash;No, no,
     Thy house, well fed and taught, can show
     No such crabb'd vizard:  Thou hast learnt thy train
     With heart and hand to entertain;
     And by the arms-full, with a breast unhid,
     As the old race of mankind did,
     When either's heart, and either's hand did strive
     To be the nearer relative;
     Thou dost redeem those times:  and what was lost
     Of ancient honesty, may boast
     It keeps a growth in thee, and so will run
     A course in thy fame's pledge, thy son.
     Thus, like a Roman Tribune, thou thy gate
     Early sets ope to feast, and late;
     Keeping no currish waiter to affright,
     With blasting eye, the appetite,
     Which fain would waste upon thy cates, but that
     The trencher creature marketh what
     Best and more suppling piece he cuts, and by
     Some private pinch tells dangers nigh,
     A hand too desp'rate, or a knife that bites
     Skin-deep into the pork, or lights
     Upon some part of kid, as if mistook,
     When checked by the butler's look.
     No, no, thy bread, thy wine, thy jocund beer
     Is not reserved for Trebius here,
     But all who at thy table seated are,
     Find equal freedom, equal fare;
     And thou, like to that hospitable god,
     Jove, joy'st when guests make their abode
     To eat thy bullocks thighs, thy veals, thy fat
     Wethers, and never grudged at.
     The pheasant, partridge, gotwit, reeve, ruff, rail,
     The cock, the curlew, and the quail,
     These, and thy choicest viands, do extend
     Their tastes unto the lower end
     Of thy glad table; not a dish more known
     To thee, than unto any one:
     But as thy meat, so thy immortal wine
     Makes the smirk face of each to shine,
     And spring fresh rose-buds, while the salt, the wit,
     Flows from the wine, and graces it;
     While Reverence, waiting at the bashful board,
     Honours my lady and my lord.
     No scurril jest, no open scene is laid
     Here, for to make the face afraid;
     But temp'rate mirth dealt forth, and so discreet-
     Ly, that it makes the meat more sweet,
     And adds perfumes unto the wine, which thou
     Dost rather pour forth, than allow
     By cruse and measure; thus devoting wine,
     As the Canary isles were thine;
     But with that wisdom and that method, as
     No one that's there his guilty glass
     Drinks of distemper, or has cause to cry
     Repentance to his liberty.
     No, thou know'st orders, ethics, and hast read
     All oeconomics, know'st to lead
     A house-dance neatly, and canst truly show
     How far a figure ought to go,
     Forward or backward, side-ward, and what pace
     Can give, and what retract a grace;
     What gesture, courtship, comeliness agrees,
     With those thy primitive decrees,
     To give subsistence to thy house, and proof
     What Genii support thy roof,
     Goodness and greatness, not the oaken piles;
     For these, and marbles have their whiles
     To last, but not their ever; virtue's hand
     It is which builds 'gainst fate to stand.
     Such is thy house, whose firm foundations trust
     Is more in thee than in her dust,
     Or depth; these last may yield, and yearly shrink,
     When what is strongly built, no chink
     Or yawning rupture can the same devour,
     But fix'd it stands, by her own power
     And well-laid bottom, on the iron and rock,
     Which tries, and counter-stands the shock
     And ram of time, and by vexation grows
     The stronger.  Virtue dies when foes
     Are wanting to her exercise, but, great
     And large she spreads by dust and sweat.
     Safe stand thy walls, and thee, and so both will,
     Since neither's height was raised by th'ill
     Of others; since no stud, no stone, no piece
     Was rear'd up by the poor-man's fleece;
     No widow's tenement was rack'd to gild
     Or fret thy cieling, or to build
     A sweating-closet, to anoint the silk-
     Soft skin, or bath[e] in asses' milk;
     No orphan's pittance, left him, served to set
     The pillars up of lasting jet,
     For which their cries might beat against thine ears,
     Or in the damp jet read their tears.
     No plank from hallow'd altar does appeal
     To yond' Star-chamber, or does seal
     A curse to thee, or thine; but all things even
     Make for thy peace, and pace to heaven.
     &mdash;Go on directly so, as just men may
     A thousand times more swear, than say
     This is that princely Pemberton, who can
     Teach men to keep a God in man;
     And when wise poets shall search out to see
     Good men, they find them all in thee.

      66. TO HIS DYING BROTHER, MASTER WILLIAM HERRICK
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Life of my life, take not so soon thy flight,
     But stay the time till we have bade good-night.
     Thou hast both wind and tide with thee; thy way
     As soon dispatch'd is by the night as day.
     Let us not then so rudely henceforth go
     Till we have wept, kiss'd, sigh'd, shook hands, or so.
     There's pain in parting, and a kind of hell
     When once true lovers take their last farewell.
     What? shall we two our endless leaves take here
     Without a sad look, or a solemn tear?
     He knows not love that hath not this truth proved,
     Love is most loth to leave the thing beloved.
     Pay we our vows and go; yet when we part,
     Then, even then, I will bequeath my heart
     Into thy loving hands; for I'll keep none
     To warm my breast, when thou, my pulse, art gone,
     No, here I'll last, and walk, a harmless shade,
     About this urn, wherein thy dust is laid,
     To guard it so, as nothing here shall be
     Heavy, to hurt those sacred seeds of thee.

    <h2>
      67. HIS AGE:
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     DEDICATED TO HIS PECULIAR FRIEND,
     MR JOHN WICKES, UNDER THE NAME OF
     POSTUMUS

     Ah, Posthumus!  our years hence fly
     And leave no sound:  nor piety,
     Or prayers, or vow
     Can keep the wrinkle from the brow;
     But we must on,
     As fate does lead or draw us; none,
     None, Posthumus, could e'er decline
     The doom of cruel Proserpine.

     The pleasing wife, the house, the ground
     Must all be left, no one plant found
     To follow thee,
     Save only the curst cypress-tree!
     &mdash;A merry mind
     Looks forward, scorns what's left behind;
     Let's live, my Wickes, then, while we may,
     And here enjoy our holiday.

     We've seen the past best times, and these
     Will ne'er return; we see the seas,
     And moons to wane,
     But they fill up their ebbs again;
     But vanish'd man,
     Like to a lily lost, ne'er can,
     Ne'er can repullulate, or bring
     His days to see a second spring.

     But on we must, and thither tend,
     Where Ancus and rich Tullus blend
     Their sacred seed;
     Thus has infernal Jove decreed;
     We must be made,
     Ere long a song, ere long a shade.
     Why then, since life to us is short,
     Let's make it full up by our sport.

     Crown we our heads with roses then,
     And 'noint with Tyrian balm; for when
     We two are dead,
     The world with us is buried.
     Then live we free
     As is the air, and let us be
     Our own fair wind, and mark each one
     Day with the white and lucky stone.

     We are not poor, although we have
     No roofs of cedar, nor our brave
     Baiae, nor keep
     Account of such a flock of sheep;
     Nor bullocks fed
     To lard the shambles; barbels bred
     To kiss our hands; nor do we wish
     For Pollio's lampreys in our dish.

     If we can meet, and so confer,
     Both by a shining salt-cellar,
     And have our roof,
     Although not arch'd, yet weather-proof,
     And cieling free,
     From that cheap candle-baudery;
     We'll eat our bean with that full mirth
     As we were lords of all the earth.

     Well, then, on what seas we are tost,
     Our comfort is, we can't be lost.
     Let the winds drive
     Our bark, yet she will keep alive
     Amidst the deeps;
     'Tis constancy, my Wickes, which keeps
     The pinnace up; which, though she errs
     I' th' seas, she saves her passengers.

     Say, we must part; sweet mercy bless
     Us both i' th' sea, camp, wilderness!
     Can we so far
     Stray, to become less circular
     Than we are now?
     No, no, that self-same heart, that vow
     Which made us one, shall ne'er undo,
     Or ravel so, to make us two.

     Live in thy peace; as for myself,
     When I am bruised on the shelf
     Of time, and show
     My locks behung with frost and snow;
     When with the rheum,
     The cough, the pthisic, I consume
     Unto an almost nothing; then,
     The ages fled, I'll call again,

     And with a tear compare these last
     Lame and bad times with those are past,
     While Baucis by,
     My old lean wife, shall kiss it dry;
     And so we'll sit
     By th' fire, foretelling snow and slit
     And weather by our aches, grown
     Now old enough to be our own

     True calendars, as puss's ear
     Wash'd o'er 's, to tell what change is near;
     Then to assuage
     The gripings of the chine by age,
     I'll call my young
     Iulus to sing such a song
     I made upon my Julia's breast,
     And of her blush at such a feast.

     Then shall he read that flower of mine
     Enclosed within a crystal shrine;
     A primrose next;
     A piece then of a higher text;
     For to beget
     In me a more transcendant heat,
     Than that insinuating fire
     Which crept into each aged sire

     When the fair Helen from her eyes
     Shot forth her loving sorceries;
     At which I'll rear
     Mine aged limbs above my chair;
     And hearing it,
     Flutter and crow, as in a fit
     Of fresh concupiscence, and cry,
     'No lust there's like to Poetry.'

     Thus frantic, crazy man, God wot,
     I'll call to mind things half-forgot;
     And oft between
     Repeat the times that I have seen;
     Thus ripe with tears,
     And twisting my Iulus' hairs,
     Doting, I'll weep and say, 'In truth,
     Baucis, these were my sins of youth.'

     Then next I'Il cause my hopeful lad,
     If a wild apple can be had,
     To crown the hearth;
     Lar thus conspiring with our mirth;
     Then to infuse
     Our browner ale into the cruse;
     Which, sweetly spiced, we'll first carouse
     Unto the Genius of the house.

     Then the next health to friends of mine.
     Loving the brave Burgundian wine,
     High sons of pith,
     Whose fortunes I have frolick'd with;
     Such as could well
     Bear up the magic bough and spell;
     And dancing 'bout the mystic Thyrse,
     Give up the just applause to verse;

     To those, and then again to thee,
     We'll drink, my Wickes, until we be
     Plump as the cherry,
     Though not so fresh, yet full as merry
     As the cricket,
     The untamed heifer, or the pricket,
     Until our tongues shall tell our ears,
     We're younger by a score of years.

     Thus, till we see the fire less shine
     From th' embers than the kitling's eyne,
     We'll still sit up,
     Sphering about the wassail cup,
     To all those times
     Which gave me honour for my rhymes;
     The coal once spent, we'll then to bed,
     Far more than night bewearied.

     Dull to myself, and almost dead to these,
     My many fresh and fragrant mistresses;
     Lost to all music now, since every thing
     Puts on the semblance here of sorrowing.
     Sick is the land to th' heart; and doth endure
     More dangerous faintings by her desperate cure.
     But if that golden age would come again,
     And Charles here rule, as he before did reign;
     If smooth and unperplex'd the seasons were,
     As when the sweet Maria lived here;
     I should delight to have my curls half drown'd

     And once more yet, ere I am laid out dead,
     Knock at a star with my exalted head.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Come thou, who art the wine and wit
     Of all I've writ;
     The grace, the glory, and the best
     Piece of the rest;
     Thou art of what I did intend
     The All, and End;
     And what was made, was made to meet.
     Thee, thee my sheet.
     Come then, and be to my chaste side
     Both bed and bride.
     We two, as reliques left, will have
     One rest, one grave;
     And, hugging close, we need not fear
     Lust entering here,
     Where all desires are dead or cold,
     As is the mould;
     And all affections are forgot,
     Or trouble not.
     Here, here the slaves and prisoners be
     From shackles free;
     And weeping widows, long opprest,
     Do here find rest.
     The wronged client ends his laws
     Here, and his cause;
     Here those long suits of Chancery lie
     Quiet, or die;
     And all Star-chamber bills do cease,
     Or hold their peace.
     Here needs no court for our Request
     Where all are best;
     All wise, all equal, and all just
     Alike i'th' dust.
     Nor need we here to fear the frown
     Of court or crown;
     Where fortune bears no sway o'er things,
     There all are kings.
     In this securer place we'll keep,
     As lull'd asleep;
     Or for a little time we'll lie,
     As robes laid by,
     To be another day re-worn,
     Turn'd, but not torn;
     Or like old testaments engrost,
     Lock'd up, not lost;
     And for a-while lie here conceal'd,
     To be reveal'd
     Next, at that great Platonic year,
     And then meet here.

     He thus began himself t'excuse:
     'Sweet lady-flower, I never brought
     Hither the least one thieving thought;
     But taking those rare lips of yours
     For some fresh, fragrant, luscious flowers,
     I thought I might there take a taste,
     Where so much sirup ran at waste.
     Besides, know this, I never sting
     The flower that gives me nourishing;
     But with a kiss, or thanks, do pay
     For honey that I bear away.'
     &mdash;This said, he laid his little scrip
     Of honey 'fore her ladyship,
     And told her, as some tears did fall,
     That, that he took, and that was all.
     At which she smiled, and bade him go
     And take his bag; but thus much know,
     When next he came a-pilfering so,
     He should from her full lips derive
     Honey enough to fill his hive.

     You are a Tulip seen to-day,
     But, Dearest, of so short a stay,
     That where you grew, scarce man can say.

     You are a lovely July-flower;
     Yet one rude wind, or ruffling shower,
     Will force you hence, and in an hour.

     You are a sparkling Rose i'th' bud,
     Yet lost, ere that chaste flesh and blood
     Can show where you or grew or stood.

     You are a full-spread fair-set Vine,
     And can with tendrils love entwine;
     Yet dried, ere you distil your wine.

     You are like Balm, enclosed well
     In amber, or some crystal shell;
     Yet lost ere you transfuse your smell.

     You are a dainty Violet;
     Yet wither'd, ere you can be set
     Within the virgins coronet.

     You are the Queen all flowers among;
     But die you must, fair maid, ere long,
     As he, the maker of this song.

     That age is best, which is the first,

     But being spent, the worse, and worst
     Times, still succeed the former.

      201. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     You have beheld a smiling rose
     When virgins' hands have drawn
     O'er it a cobweb-lawn:
     And here, you see, this lily shows,
     Tomb'd in a crystal stone,
     More fair in this transparent case
     Than when it grew alone,
     And had but single grace.

     You see how cream but naked is,
     Nor dances in the eye
     Without a strawberry;
     Or some fine tincture, like to this,
     Which draws the sight thereto,
     More by that wantoning with it,
     Than when the paler hue
     No mixture did admit.

     You see how amber through the streams
     More gently strokes the sight,
     With some conceal'd delight,
     Than when he darts his radiant beams
     Into the boundless air;
     Where either too much light his worth
     Doth all at once impair,
     Or set it little forth.

     Put purple grapes or cherries in-
     To glass, and they will send
     More beauty to commend
     Them, from that clean and subtle skin,
     Than if they naked stood,
     And had no other pride at all,
     But their own flesh and blood,
     And tinctures natural.

     Thus lily, rose, grape, cherry, cream,
     And strawberry do stir
     More love, when they transfer
     A weak, a soft, a broken beam;
     Than if they should discover
     At full their proper excellence,
     Without some scene cast over,
     To juggle with the sense.

     Thus let this crystall'd lily be
     A rule, how far to teach
     Your nakedness must reach;
     And that no further than we see
     Those glaring colours laid
     By art's wise hand, but to this end
     They should obey a shade,
     Lest they too far extend.

     &mdash;So though you're white as swan or snow,
     And have the power to move
     A world of men to love;
     Yet, when your lawns and silks shall flow,
     And that white cloud divide
     Into a doubtful twilight;&mdash;then,
     Then will your hidden pride
     Raise greater fires in men.

     A Gyges ring they bear about them still,
     To be, and not seen when and where they will;

     They fall like dew, and make no noise at all:
     So silently they one to th' other come,

     And air-like, leave no pression to be seen
     Where'er they met, or parting place has been.

      216. THE KISS: A DIALOGUE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1  Among thy fancies, tell me this,
     What is the thing we call a kiss?
     2  I shall resolve ye what it is:&mdash;

     It is a creature born and bred
     Between the lips, all cherry-red,
     By love and warm desires fed,&mdash;
     CHOR.  And makes more soft the bridal bed.

     2  It is an active flame, that flies
     First to the babies of the eyes,
     And charms them there with lullabies,&mdash;
     CHOR.  And stills the bride, too, when she cries.

     2  Then to the chin, the cheek, the ear,
     It frisks and flies, now here, now there:
     'Tis now far off, and then 'tis near,&mdash;
     CHOR.  And here, and there, and every where.

     1  Has it a speaking virtue?  2  Yes.
     1  How speaks it, say?  2  Do you but this,&mdash;
     Part your join'd lips, then speaks your kiss;
     CHOR.  And this Love's sweetest language is.

     1  Has it a body?  2  Ay, and wings,
     With thousand rare encolourings;
     And as it flies, it gently sings&mdash;
     CHOR.  Love honey yields, but never stings.

      230. A THANKSGIVING TO GOD, FOR HIS HOUSE

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Lord, thou hast given me a cell,
     Wherein to dwell;
     A little house, whose humble roof
     Is weather proof;
     Under the spars of which I lie
     Both soft and dry;
     Where thou, my chamber for to ward,
     Hast set a guard
     Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep
     Me, while I sleep.
     Low is my porch, as is my fate;
     Both void of state;
     And yet the threshold of my door
     Is worn by th' poor,
     Who thither come, and freely get
     Good words, or meat.
     Like as my parlour, so my hall
     And kitchen's small;
     A little buttery, and therein
     A little bin,
     Which keeps my little loaf of bread
     Unchipt, unflead;
     Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar
     Make me a fire,
     Close by whose living coal I sit,
     And glow like it.
     Lord, I confess too, when I dine,
     The pulse is thine,
     And all those other bits that be
     There placed by thee;
     The worts, the purslain, and the mess
     Of water-cress,
     Which of thy kindness thou hast sent;
     And my content
     Makes those, and my beloved beet,
     To be more sweet.
     'Tis thou that crown'st my glittering hearth
     With guiltless mirth,
     And giv'st me wassail bowls to drink,
     Spiced to the brink.
     Lord, 'tis thy plenty-dropping hand
     That soils my land,
     And giv'st me, for my bushel sown,
     Twice ten for one;
     Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay
     Her egg each day;
     Besides, my healthful ewes to bear
     Me twins each year;
     The while the conduits of my kine
     Run cream, for wine:
     All these, and better, thou dost send
     Me, to this end,&mdash;
     That I should render, for my part,
     A thankful heart;
     Which, fired with incense, I resign,
     As wholly thine;
     &mdash;But the acceptance, that must be,
     My Christ, by Thee.

     And dismal darkness then doth smutch the face.

      244. THE DIRGE OF JEPHTHAH'S DAUGHTER: SUNG BY THE VIRGINS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O thou, the wonder of all days!
     O paragon, and pearl of praise!
     O Virgin-martyr, ever blest
     Above the rest
     Of all the maiden-train!  We come,
     And bring fresh strewings to thy tomb.

     Thus, thus, and thus, we compass round
     Thy harmless and unhaunted ground;
     And as we sing thy dirge, we will
     The daffadil,
     And other flowers, lay upon
     The altar of our love, thy stone.

     Thou wonder of all maids, liest here,
     Of daughters all, the dearest dear;
     The eye of virgins; nay, the queen
     Of this smooth green,
     And all sweet meads, from whence we get
     The primrose and the violet.

     Too soon, too dear did Jephthah buy,
     By thy sad loss, our liberty;
     His was the bond and cov'nant, yet
     Thou paid'st the debt;
     Lamented Maid!  he won the day:
     But for the conquest thou didst pay.

     Thy father brought with him along
     The olive branch and victor's song;
     He slew the Ammonites, we know,
     But to thy woe;
     And in the purchase of our peace,
     The cure was worse than the disease.

     For which obedient zeal of thine,
     We offer here, before thy shrine,
     Our sighs for storax, tears for wine;
     And to make fine
     And fresh thy hearse-cloth, we will here
     Four times bestrew thee every year.

     Receive, for this thy praise, our tears;
     Receive this offering of our hairs;
     Receive these crystal vials, fill'd
     With tears, distill'd
     From teeming eyes; to these we bring,
     Each maid, her silver filleting,

     To gild thy tomb; besides, these cauls,
     These laces, ribbons, and these falls,
     These veils, wherewith we use to hide
     The bashful bride,
     When we conduct her to her groom;
     All, all we lay upon thy tomb.

     No more, no more, since thou art dead,
     Shall we e'er bring coy brides to bed;
     No more, at yearly festivals,
     We, cowslip balls,
     Or chains of columbines shall make,
     For this or that occasion's sake.

     No, no; our maiden pleasures be
     Wrapt in the winding-sheet with thee;
     'Tis we are dead, though not i' th' grave;
     Or if we have
     One seed of life left, 'tis to keep
     A Lent for thee, to fast and weep.

     Sleep in thy peace, thy bed of spice,
     And make this place all paradise;
     May sweets grow here, and smoke from hence
     Fat frankincense;
     Let balm and cassia send their scent
     From out thy maiden-monument.

     May no wolf howl, or screech owl stir
     A wing about thy sepulchre!
     No boisterous winds or storms come hither,
     To starve or wither
     Thy soft sweet earth; but, like a spring,
     Love keep it ever flourishing.

     May all shy maids, at wonted hours,
     Come forth to strew thy tomb with flowers;
     May virgins, when they come to mourn,
     Male-incense burn
     Upon thine altar; then return,
     And leave thee sleeping in thy urn.

      245. THE WIDOWS' TEARS; OR, DIRGE OF DORCAS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Come pity us, all ye who see
     Our harps hung on the willow-tree;
     Come pity us, ye passers-by,
     Who see or hear poor widows' cry;
     Come pity us, and bring your ears
     And eyes to pity widows' tears.
     CHOR.  And when you are come hither,
     Then we will keep
     A fast, and weep
     Our eyes out all together,

     For Tabitha; who dead lies here,
     Clean wash'd, and laid out for the bier.
     O modest matrons, weep and wail!
     For now the corn and wine must fail;
     The basket and the bin of bread,
     Wherewith so many souls were fed,
     CHOR.  Stand empty here for ever;
     And ah!  the poor,
     At thy worn door,
     Shall be relieved never.

     Woe worth the time, woe worth the day,
     That reft us of thee, Tabitha!
     For we have lost, with thee, the meal,
     The bits, the morsels, and the deal
     Of gentle paste and yielding dough,
     That thou on widows did bestow.
     CHOR.  All's gone, and death hath taken
     Away from us
     Our maundy; thus
     Thy widows stand forsaken.

     Ah, Dorcas, Dorcas!  now adieu
     We bid the cruise and pannier too;
     Ay, and the flesh, for and the fish,
     Doled to us in that lordly dish.
     We take our leaves now of the loom
     From whence the housewives' cloth did come;
     CHOR.  The web affords now nothing;
     Thou being dead,
     The worsted thread
     Is cut, that made us clothing.

     Farewell the flax and reaming wool,
     With which thy house was plentiful;
     Farewell the coats, the garments, and
     The sheets, the rugs, made by thy hand;
     Farewell thy fire and thy light,
     That ne'er went out by day or night:&mdash;
     CHOR.  No, or thy zeal so speedy,
     That found a way,
     By peep of day,
     To feed and clothe the needy.

     But ah, alas!  the almond-bough
     And olive-branch is wither'd now;
     The wine-press now is ta'en from us,
     The saffron and the calamus;
     The spice and spikenard hence is gone,
     The storax and the cinnamon;
     CHOR.  The carol of our gladness
     Has taken wing;
     And our late spring
     Of mirth is turn'd to sadness.

     How wise wast thou in all thy ways!
     How worthy of respect and praise!
     How matron-like didst thou go drest!
     How soberly above the rest
     Of those that prank it with their plumes,
     And jet it with their choice perfumes!
     CHOR.  Thy vestures were not flowing;
     Nor did the street
     Accuse thy feet
     Of mincing in their going.

     And though thou here liest dead, we see
     A deal of beauty yet in thee.
     How sweetly shews thy smiling face,
     Thy lips with all diffused grace!
     Thy hands, though cold, yet spotless, white,
     And comely as the chrysolite.
     CHOR.  Thy belly like a hill is,
     Or as a neat
     Clean heap of wheat,
     All set about with lilies.

     Sleep with thy beauties here, while we
     Will shew these garments made by thee;
     These were the coats; in these are read
     The monuments of Dorcas dead:
     These were thy acts, and thou shalt have
     These hung as honours o'er thy grave:&mdash;
     CHOR.  And after us, distressed,
     Should fame be dumb,
     Thy very tomb
     Would cry out, Thou art blessed.

     And half damns me with untruth,
     Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

     When the flames and hellish cries
     Fright mine ears, and fright mine eyes,
     And all terrors me surprise,
     Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

     When the Judgment is reveal'd,
     And that open'd which was seal'd;
     When to Thee I have appeal'd,
     Sweet Spirit, comfort me!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
